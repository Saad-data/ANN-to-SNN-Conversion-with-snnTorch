**Prerequisites**
Before running this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script requires the following libraries:
**Libraries:** 
torch
matplotlib
snntorch

**You can install these dependencies using pip:**
pip install torch matplotlib snntorch


**Running the Script**
Ensure all the prerequisites are installed.
Save the snntorch_anntosnn.py script to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.

**Run the script using Python:**
python snntorch_anntosnn.py

**Understanding the Code**

**The script consists of several key parts:**
SimpleANN: A class that defines a simple ANN with one fully connected layer and ReLU activation.
SimpleSNN: A class that defines a corresponding SNN with one fully connected layer followed by a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model.
test_performance: A function to measure the performance of a given model with provided input data.
Visualization: The script generates and visualizes the output of the ANN and the output of the SNN over multiple time steps.
The output will include printed performance metrics (output values and time taken) for the ANN. It will also display a plot comparing the activation of the ANN's output neurons with the activation of the SNN's output neurons over time.
